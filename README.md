## 🚴‍♂️ Buenos Aires Bike Adoption Analysis
This project focuses on supporting the goal of increasing the bike ride adoption rate for the Buenos Aires bicycle-sharing system. Using real-world ride and station data, the analysis uncovers key insights to improve the availability and efficiency of bike stations across the city.

Through exploratory data analysis, the project identifies usage patterns, such as the most popular stations, peak times during the week, and average ride durations. Additionally, it highlights any imbalances in bike distribution, offering recommendations for optimizing bike allocation and enhancing user experience.

Further, the project suggests data model improvements to better track user behavior and retention, providing actionable KPIs to monitor progress toward the adoption target. Finally, based on the findings, it proposes new app features and data collection strategies to drive engagement and system efficiency.

Bonus analyses are included, incorporating train and subway station data to understand multi-modal transit patterns and how they relate to bike usage in the city.
